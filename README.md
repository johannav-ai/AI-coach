# AI Coach – Helping employees use AI  

Final project for the Building AI course*  

## Summary  

AI Coach is an AI-powered assistant that helps employees adopt AI in their daily work.  
It gives guidance on how to write effective prompts, which tools to try, and provides tips for problem-solving and productivity.  
The goal is to lower the barrier to start using AI and make it truly useful at work.  

## Background  

Many employees have heard about AI, but  

* they don’t know where to start  
* they feel uncertain or afraid of making mistakes  
* they struggle to write effective prompts  
* they don’t see how AI could help in their specific role  

As a result, AI potential often remains unused.  

My motivation:  
I have seen how difficult it can be for employees to take the first steps with AI. I want to build a tool that lowers the threshold, encourages experimentation, and offers practical support.  

AI literacy will soon be as essential as basic computer skills. Without guidance, many people will be left behind.  


## How is it used?  

Usage situation:  
1. An employee faces a task that feels slow, repetitive, or complex  
2. They open AI Coach and describe their situation (for example: *“I need to summarize this report for a customer in plain language”*)  
3. AI Coach suggests prompt examples, recommends suitable tools (for example Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude), and explains how to best use the result  

Users:  
- Office and project workers  
- Marketing and communications professionals  
- Industry specialists such as construction experts who are not familiar with AI  

Needs:  
- Practical, easy-to-use tips  
- Guidance for writing good prompts  
- Concrete examples of how AI can help in their daily work  


## Data sources and AI methods  

Data  
- Prompt examples and tips collected from public resources, company best practices, and open guides such as Microsoft Copilot documentation and OpenAI guides  
- Anonymous user feedback could be used to improve the tool over time  

AI methods  
- Natural language processing (NLP) to understand user questions  
- Generative language models such as ChatGPT or Claude to propose prompts and solutions  
- A recommendation system to suggest tools and use cases for different situations  


## Example use cases  

AI Coach can respond to questions like:  

- Prompt help:** *“Write me a prompt template for creating a customer email.”*  
- Tool recommendation:** *“What is the best tool to analyze an Excel sheet automatically?”*  
- Ideation:** *“How can I use AI in project management?”*  
- Troubleshooting:** *“Copilot doesn’t understand my request. What can I try instead?”*  
- Learning:** *“What should I know about the ethical risks of AI in my role?”*  


## Challenges  

- AI cannot know everything. It gives suggestions, not absolute truths  
- Ethical risks: employees might enter sensitive data. Clear data security guidelines are needed  
- Different levels of digital skills: guidance must work for both beginners and advanced users  
- It does not solve the entire culture change. Leadership and training are also needed  


## What next?  

AI Coach could evolve into  

- An interactive chatbot available in Teams, Slack, or the company intranet  
- A personalized guide that learns from the user’s role and suggests tailored tips  
- A training platform with exercises, tasks, and feedback  
- Integration into Copilot or other workplace tools, so support appears directly in the workflow  

To grow further, the project would need  
AI developers, pilot companies, and continuous user feedback
